# Alex Schloegl's blog

Hi, and welcome to my simple first version of a blog.
My name is Alex and I'm a PhD student in computer science at the University of Innsbruck.
I do research on security of machine learning, but try to stay away from the classical "we found a new adversarial attack/defense" way of doing that.

In my work I sometimes learn or find out cool things that I would like to share, but that are not significant enough to try and publish.
That's what this "blog" is for.
It's meant to be a way of sharing my findings with future me and others who might be interested in the stuff I found.

The current organization is just a rough draft based on multiple markdown files, because I started on a thursday evening just randomly starting to type.
Maybe I'll go for something more sophisticated later, but for now this is it.
